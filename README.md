This repository is the result of the Formation PHP course of <a href="https://www.alura.com.br" target="_blank"><strong>Alura</strong></a> where I learned and practiced the language fundamental with good practices and the essential knowledge of a good object oriented modeling.

<h2 id="text1">Introduction to PHP Getting started with a language</h2>

<p>
  Where it all begins! With a <strong>hello world</strong>, of course! In this repository is the first chapter of the PHP study, where you can find simple code examples with some activities using basic structures like for, if, while and etc. Then to ends with a <em>"challenge"</em> to use everything that has been studied in this chapter.
</p>

<p><code>echo "Hello World!;</code></p>

<br>

<h2 id="text2">Moving forward with PHP Arrays, Strings, Function and Web</h2>

<p>
  Advancing in content, we will see new things, like arrays and array in array (<em>associative arrays</em>), encapsulation and discoveries in the <strong>world of the web!       </strong> And of course, we cannot forget the study more about strings and interpolation, to finish passing some variables using references or values (have difference!).
</p>

<br>

<h2 id="text3">Object orientation with PHP classes, methods and attributes</h2>

<p>
At this moment where we separate the man from the boys! In fact, now we're talking about <strong>O.O.</strong> (<em>Object Oriented</em>). In this repository, you will find examples of studies on <strong>constructors</strong>, <strong>static methods</strong>, <strong>code reuse</strong> and some theories about this part of programming.
</p>

<br>

<h2 id="text4">Advancing Object Oriented with PHP: Inheritance, Polymorphism and Interfaces</h2>

<p>
 I went deeper into this subject studying how to work, use and configure namespace, alias, interfaces. The difference between abstract classes and interfaces, how to use inheritance and grant a method to not be overwritten
